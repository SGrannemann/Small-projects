# Python-Address-Book
Simple address book app to practice Python.
This was/is a practice project especially for reading and writing to CSV files. The CSV can be modified via the CLI only.

Project is more or less finished as of September 2020 - there are other projects that are related to my work that I want to focus on and this "app" has all the functionality I planned for.

Might use this project in the future to practice new aspects, like connecting databases, writing MVC code for GUIs etc.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
