# Python-Address-Book
Simple address book app to practice Python.
For now, the planned functionalities include:

Create, Read, Update, Delete entries in the address book.
The address book is saved as a CSV file (later: XML file and after
that a SQL-based database.)
User Login System with one address book per user.
GUI (maybe)
