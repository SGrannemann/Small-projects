## Included projects

### Whisky Checker

Small script that reads in a list of whiskys from a text file and opens the two best search results from the whisky.de shop site for them. 

I used this to check if I wanted to buy an Advent calendar with whiskys. I copied the list of whiskys contained in the calendar from Amazon to the file and then used the script to check their description and rating.


_Hint_: Next time I'd try scraping the amazon product description to avoid manually copying the text into the txt.
