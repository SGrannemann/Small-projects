# JavaPractice-Hangman
Simple Hangman game to practice making classes, reading and writing files, ... .

My first try at object-oriented design. If you have any feedback on that,

The game selects a word from a provided .txt file that contains one word to guess
per file line.
It then "masks" the word, i.e. it prints one asterisk symbol for each non-whitespace
character of the word.
